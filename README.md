I love to code !

I have been developing websites and applications for around 5 years. Most of my experience lies in Full Stack Development, developing POC's, fixing security vulnerabilities to
solve challenging project related tasks. I work with Angular, ReactJS, Javascript, typescript, jQuery, HTML/CSS/SASS, NodeJS, Firebase and many more on VSCode.
